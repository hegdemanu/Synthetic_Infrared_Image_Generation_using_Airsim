The Discriminator implementation includes several key features:

Dilated convolutions with increasing dilation rates (1, 2, 4) for preserving spatial hierarchy.
Instance normalization for style-based discrimination.
PatchGAN architecture for local and global feature discrimination.
LeakyReLU activation for stable training.
Proper weight initialization methods.

The test script verifies:

Model architecture and parameter count.
Forward pass functionality and output shapes.
Receptive field changes from dilated convolutions.
Weight initialization correctness.
