The loss implementation includes several key components:

Adversarial Loss: For both generator and discriminator training using MSE loss.
Cycle Consistency Loss: Ensures bidirectional mapping consistency using L1 loss.
Infrared Loss: Preserves thermal characteristics using radiation value metrics.
Structure Loss: Maintains structural information using gradient correlation.
Refinement Loss: Combines infrared and structure losses.
Total Loss: Weighted combination of all loss components.
